# GlucoLog - Blood Glucose Tracker & Charting App

## Description
- GlucoLog is a user-friendly mobile application designed to simplify the process of logging and monitoring blood glucose readings.
- The app provides an intuitive interface for users to record their blood glucose levels and offers comprehensive charting features for visualizing their data trends over time.
- With GlucoLog, users can easily track their glucose readings and gain valuable insights into their health patterns.

## Goals
- To create a mobile application which will allow users to keep track of their blood glucose levels.
- The users will log their readings, which will then be used to calculate certain metrics and generate useful and easy-to-interpret charts.
- This would introduce team members to ideas about managing data, privacy, authentication and visualization.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend (App development)
    * Flutter and Dart
- Backend
    * Flexible and open to suggestions.
    * APIs, user authentication and database would be some of the key things which will be setup during the course of the project.

## Team Requirements (Flexible)
- Backend: `2 people`
- Frontend: `2 people`
- Research (UI/UX, figuring out details about health-related aspects of the app) - `1 person`

## Note
- Anyone willing to contribute is welcome!
- Beginners are welcome!
- You do not need to know everything to begin with, but would be a plus-point if you are familiar with the tech stack. Nevertheless, you can learn as the project progresses.
